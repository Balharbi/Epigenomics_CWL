# Generate GREAT Report for a Set of Regions of Interest

## Description

As a biologist, I would like to see a GREAT report for some regions of interest (e.g. DMRs), in order to determine their functional relevance. 

## Notes

- Input: a list of regions, in BED format

- Output: HTML document containing GREAT annotations

- GREAT is a tool for performing functional analysis of differentially methylated regions. It is web based, but an R API exists.

# Generate Methylation BigWIGs

## Description

As a bioinformatician, I would like to generate bigWIG files containing DNA methylation calls in single cell, in order to speed up downstream plotting and genome browsing.

## Notes

- Input will be tsv-like DNA methylation calls, and can be converted to a standard format via Interconvert Methylation Calls

- Output should be one bigWIG file per cell input

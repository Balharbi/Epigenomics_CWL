# Run DeepCpG Over Two Sets of Cells

## Description

As a biologist, I would like to run DeepCpG over two sets of single-cell DNA methylation data, in order to find differentially methylated regions and CpGs between them. 

## Notes

- DeepCpG is on GitHub. There is also a preprint manuscript.

- It does both imputation of missing data and calling of differentially methylated regions; we may want to split this into two separate tools 

## Priority: SHOULD

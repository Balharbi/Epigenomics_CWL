# Setup software

## Description
As a developer I would like have all the necessary software installed on a shared AMI server in order to run each stage of the future pipelines

## Notes
 - Python 3 (anaconda)
 - R/Bioconductor
 - CWL runner / tools
 - LOLA (Bioc)
 - RGREAT (Bioc)
 - bedgraph2bigwig (script) - requires input preprocessing
 - docker (for amazon)

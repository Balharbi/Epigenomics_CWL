# Call Copy Number From Single-Cell DNA Methylation Data

## Description
As a biologist, I would like to use the reads from single-cell DNA methylation data to call copy number in individual cells, in order to sex them, and to detect any copy number variations from normal.


## Notes

- Input: BAM files, one for each cell

- Desired output: copy number calls, by ~5mbp bin, in some lightweight format (eg tsv), per cell

# A CWL Pipeline and Docker Image for Performing Standard Single-Cell DNA Methylation Analyses

Single-cell whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (SC-WGBS) is currently the most comprehensive method for investigating single-cell epigenomic regulation, with important applications for understanding stem cell differentiation and oncogenesis. However, it is a very new field, and while a handful of tools have been developed, no standard pipeline or framework for handling this data has been created, despite a number of analyses being common across the studies which have been published so far.

The purpose of this project is to provide a standardised workflow and framework for building workflows for analysing single-cell DNA methylation data. We will do this by wrapping several existing tools to create CWL modules, which we will build into complete example pipelines. All modules will be provided as part of an executable-anywhere Docker image. We will use several existing single-cell DNA methylation data sets, none of which have been interrogated using the full suite of tools currently available.
